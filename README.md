# 🌱 Mycelium Grants Agent

Part of the [Meeko Mycelium](https://github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell/meeko-nerve-center) organism.

This agent runs autonomously every day and:
- Searches for new grant opportunities using SerpAPI
- Scores them for fit (humanitarian, digital art, open source, solo artist)
- Drafts and sends application emails automatically via AI
- Tracks every application and its status
- Never applies to the same grant twice

## Who this is for
You. Anyone who forks it. Change the project description, keep the engine.
Free money finding you while you sleep.
